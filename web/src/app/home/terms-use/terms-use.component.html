              Townscript offers organizers a web-based solution to organize events and meetings, to sell tickets or
              provide online Attendee Registration solutions via the Townscript-Websites for events of the organizer to
              customers by using Townscript to take on the payment process. In detail Townscript provides the following
              services to the organizer (each an "Townscript-Service"):
            </p>
            <p>
              A web-based software on the Townscript-websites to organize events and to sell tickets of the organizer
              for these events to ticket buyers. The organizer has the possibility to create an own website for their
              event ("eventsite") and to offer a ticket sale. The ticket buyer can choose and buy the tickets on the
              eventsite directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only the user and the organizer of an event are entering into an agreement regarding the event and the
              disposal of tickets for that event. Townscript only acts as a sales agent for the organizer of an event by
              order and for account of this organizer. It is the organizers' duty to advise and instruct the ticket
              buyers of their eventually existing right of objection according to the legal guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
              The organizer authorises Townscript hereby for the duration of this agreement to act as an agent by order
              and for account of the organizer, to sell tickets to the public for events, offered by the organizer on
              the Townscript-Websites, to undertake the payment process with the ticket buyers and/or their banks and to
              ship the tickets to the ticket buyers. By providing Townscript with such authorization, organizer also
              agrees to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement. This authorization also contains the right of Townscript
              to send payment reminders to the ticket buyers.

          <h4 class="subheading">Payment and Fees</h4>
          <div class="static-content">
            <p>
              Townscript products & services are available on the basis of transaction model, as per the requirements of
              customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Townscript will be responsible only for the taxes applicable on Townscript Fees (including TS fee, PG fee
              and fixed ticket charge). Organizer will bear the full responsibility of the taxes applicable on ticket
              price and Townscript can not be held accountable for any inaccurate information provided by organizer for
              such taxes.

              In this model, pricing is applied on each ticket sale/attendee registration.
            </p>
            <p>
              The organizer has to determine the base price for his tickets. This base price belongs to the organizer as
              far as nothing different is stated in these terms. The organizer can choose whether the additional fees
              payable to Townscript (fees for accounting, shipment etc.) are charged on top of this base price or not.
            </p>
            <p>
              Townscript charges a fee for every ticket sold via the Townscript-Websites (A convenience-fee) as stated
              in the price list published on the Townscript-Websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to that Townscript charges a fee for accounting tickets according to clause 4 as well as for
              using the Townscript-Websites by the organizer (A ticketing-fee) as stated in the price list published on
              the Townscript-Websites. The rate of the fee depends by the payment method chosen by the organizer. The
              ticketing-fee is charged even if the tickets shall be deposited and paid on the venue.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the event that tickets for an event have been sold via the Townscript-Websites, and the event is
              cancelled for any reason not directly attributable to Townscript, then Townscript shall continue to be
              entitled to the convenience fees and ticketing fees.

          <div class="static-content">
            <p>
              If an event for which tickets are sold or already have been sold via Townscript shall be cancelled or
              changed (regarding date, time, venue or other important points) the organizer has to inform Townscript
              immediately in writing once these circumstances have come to his attention.

          <div class="static-content">
            <p>
              The organizer has options of various payment method(s) (credit card, direct debiting, prepayment, invoice)
              to be offered to possible ticket buyers. In accordance to this choice Townscript undertakes accounting for
              the organizer and holds the money on a separate bank account. The organizer authorises Townscript to do
              so. Townscript transfers the money received according to service pricing minus the fees payable to
              Townscript within 5 to 7 days to the organizer. The money has to be transferred to a bank account located
              in the country where the event took place and issued on the name of the organizer. For recurring events,
              Townscript reserves the right to pay out money before the event. Townscript reserves the right to change
              the number of days to transfer money to the event organizer at any time without notice. The organizer is
              aware of the risk that specific payment methods (direct debiting or credit card) can be reversed by the
              ticket buyers. The organizer bears this risk alone. If transactions are reversed after the payment to the
              organizer, these costs plus a fee for the reversed transaction as stated in the price list published on
              the Townscript-Websites are charged to the organizer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The organizer is obliged to raise objections, if any, against the accounts of Townscript within four weeks
              after issue of the account. If not the account is considered as being approved.

          <div class="static-content">
            <p>
              The Townscript-Websites offer an extensive security system, in particular to protect organizers against
              reimbursement of credit card payments. Because of this security system it is possible that in exceptional
              cases some credit card providers may not be accepted.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the organizer arouses suspicion of misusage of the Townscript-Websites, Townscript has the right to
              deactivate the ticket shop of the organizer and to stop the ticket selling. In particular a suspicion of
              misusage of the Townscript-Websites is on hand, if it comes to attention before the event that the event
              shall not (or not in the way as stated in the ticket shop) take place; or
              illegal or immoral events shall take place; or
            </p>
            <p>
              If the organizer arouses suspicion of misusage of the Townscript-Websites, Townscript has the right to
              delay the payout to the organizer even after 5 to 7 days for further 60 days. Within these 60 days
              Townscript will check if an improper use of the Townscript-Websites and / or Townscript-Services occurred.
